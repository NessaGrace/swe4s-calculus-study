I am male

I am black

I am getting my bachelors in creative technology design

Fall 2020

I took trigonometry

I’m interested in web and app design.

I understood the concepts a little but I was somewhat confused the whole course. After the class I didn’t feel confident as a member
 
The hardest topic for me were continuity, but the easiest was integration

I imagined a scientist as old white men who have been working for a few decades.

I was interested in art design and calculus 1 did get me a little more interested on math after taking the course

I was given feedback on occasion.

Yes, partial credit was given on everything.

I would get called on occasionally but never when my hand was down.

The instructor was good and was available for office hours, and even answered emails outside of them.

The classroom was very collaborative and we discussed problems in class that weren't understood as well.

Yes, it's a major requirement.

You're welcome.
