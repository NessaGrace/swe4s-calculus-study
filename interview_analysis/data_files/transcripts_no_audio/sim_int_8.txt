I am female

I am hispanic

I’m getting my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering

I took calculus 1 in fall of 2019

I have taken AP calculus

I wanted to go into building aircrafts for the military, and calculus 1 didn’t change that.

I feel I did well understanding the concepts due to my previous calculus experiences, and I felt well prepared for Calculus 2.

The hardest topics were derivatives and continuity, but integration was the easiest.

I always saw a scientist as a thin old white or asian person with glasses and salt and pepper hair.

I was interested in trigonometry and other related math, and the calculus cores were very related to my interests.

I don’t remember it happening too often.

I always received some form of partial credit.

I don’t really remember how often I was called on.

The instructor was good, she was open to explain topics several times if needed, and she could give different real world examples of most concepts we were learning.

The class was not very collaborative but questions were welcomed during lecture.

Yes, I was intrigued and it’s a course requirement in my major.

Thank you.
