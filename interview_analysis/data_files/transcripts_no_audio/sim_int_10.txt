I am trans-female

No i don’t mind, I am white

I am getting my degree in Statistics and data science

I took calculus fall 2022

I had taken trigonometry

I wanted to go into data sciences

I struggled, due to the speed of the course and I had a hard time grasping the concepts. I don’t feel as confident for calculus 2

The hardest was limits and the easiest was derivatives.

I thought of someone who had glasses and was in their late middle ages.

I’m interested in data analysis and statistics, which I felt didn’t really relate as closely to calculus.

I was praised sometimes.

Partial credit was given all the time for everything 

I was called on pretty often but never when my hand was down.

The instructor was ok, they could answer questions multiple ways to help us understand, but they were rarely in the office for office hours.

Students could ask some questions but we weren’t given any collaborative assignments.

Yes, it’s a part of my major requirement.

Of course thank you for interviewing me
