I am non-binary

I am Native descent.

I am currently getting my Bachelors in Molecular, cellular and developmental biology

Spring 2022.

I took pre-calculus before in high school.

I wanted to go into the biomedical field and calculus did not change that really.

I feel like I didn’t get much conceptual understanding of the course work, because the class was very fast paced. I was not motivated to take calculus 2.

Derivatives were harder, but differentiation was the earliest.

Before calculus 1 my image of a scientist in STEM was that it’s someone with vast knowledge of multiple topics, but they are typically white men from at least upper middle class families or a family of
researchers.

I am interested in biological systems and cancer research, I feel like calculus 1 did not relate to those interests at all.

Not much feedback was given back on work unless it was incorrect.

I received partial credit for most assignments.

When my hand was raised I got called on decently, but not really if my hand wasn’t raised.

I feel like the instructor was not the best at explaining topics to the class, but they tried to give better explanations when they could.

The instructor mostly lectured and it did not feel like we were able to ask many questions. 

I didn’t go to take calculus 2, because it is not needed for my major.

No problem, thank you.
