I am female

I am of Irish and Honduran descent

I am getting my Bachelors in Astronomy

I took calculus 1 in fall 2021

I had taken Pre calculus

I wanted to go into astronomy, and calculus didn’t change that.

I feel I did ok in understanding the concepts, but I felt less confident in taking calculus 2.

The hardest topic was derivatives but the easiest was integration.

I think of a middle aged white man with glasses.

I am interested in star contents and several aspects of space, and I felt like they were loosely related to calculus.

I praised on occasion for my work.

Partial credit was given often.

I was called on decently but only sometimes when my hand wasn’t raised

The instructor was ok, they moved fast across topics and didn’t really try to give extra explanations.

The class was encouraged to ask questions on occasion but not too often, we mostly would take notes while the instructor spoke.

Yes, it’s a part of my major courses.

Thank you for interviewing me
